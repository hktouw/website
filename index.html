    <p style="font-style:italic; text-align:center; color:#A6A6A6; opacity:.9;">an aspiring software engineering professional who loves cultivating relationships, creating software, and studying Japanese - all for the convergence of business, technology, and the social good.
    </p>

    </br>

    <p>My name is Harrison and I am from Santa Barbara, California; but I currently live in Oakland, California where I do freelance software engineering and go on crazy adventures. 
    </p>

    <p>Although my university degrees are in Political Science and Philosophy, I am a software engineer by trade, developing mostly Ruby on Rails web applications while also dabbling in Linux Server Administration and Angular.js (however, I still do enjoy reading some Kierkegaard, Nishitani and Foucault from time to time). I also have business development experience in the software world, particularly in the Japan and South Korean Markets. 
    </p>

    <p>Probably due to my exposure from traveling frequently to Japan for work, I have really grown to love the Japanese people, culture, and language. I find the people and culture to be very fascinating and while I do not profess to be fluent in the language yet, I have really enjoyed studying it for the few years that I have.  
    </p>

    <p>On the horizon for me is the continued pursuit of sharpening my Japanese and software engineering skills.
