    <p style="font-style:italic; text-align:center; color:#A6A6A6; opacity:.9;">a software engineering professional who loves cultivating relationships, creating software, and studying Japanese - all for the convergence of business, technology, and the social good.

    <p>HI, I'm Harrison. I’m a software engineering professional who is passionate about writing well-designed, product-centric code that is both functional and maintainable. Currently I develop software at GreatSchools, an education tech non-profit with the mission of empowering parents to get a great education for their children. </p>

    <p>I started out my career doing embedded-software business development primarily in Japan & South Korea, but now I am a software engineer by trade and passion. Over the past several years I’ve been developing mostly Ruby on Rails web applications while also enthusiastically exploring DevOps/Unix Server Administration. (however, I still do enjoy reading some Kierkegaard, Nishitani and Foucault from time to time)</p>

    <p>Probably due to my exposure from traveling frequently to Japan for work, I have really grown to love the Japanese people, culture, and language. I find the people and culture to be very fascinating and while I do not profess to be fluent in the language yet, I have really enjoyed studying it for the few years that I have.
    </p>

    <p>On the horizon for me is the continued pursuit of sharpening my Japanese and software engineering skills.</p>
