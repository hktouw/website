                        <li style="font-size:20px; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Business Development, Strategic Accounts</li>
                        <li> Green Hills is an embedded software company that has developed compilers, debuggers, and RTOSs for 30 years across multiple industries. Since Green Hills develops software at such a low level, Green Hills also works closely with semiconductor companies and other middleware companies to provide a complete software solution to end customers. </li> 

                        <li>My job was to manage client-relationships and help shape product development/roadmap decisions; pursuing Green Hills' market-share growth while balancing the needs of customers and 3rd party business partners. To do this, I developed and maintained new business relationships with Manager, Director, and VP – level clients from various Global 500 companies in Asia, US, and Europe. Some of these companies included Sony, Samsung, Hyundai, Nissan, Suzuki, Renesas, etc... I would also frequently travel on business trips to Japan & Korea to visit clients/partners, working closely with local/international business development and engineering teams. As a result, I developed many professional skills such as; client management skills, business communication, professionalism, etc...</li>

                        <li style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">A memorable moment at Green Hills</span>: It was a hot summer afternoon in Nagoya, Japan and we were having lunch with one of our largest customers, Denso. In typical Japanese fashion, 5 of us sat on one side of the long table while 5 of them sat on the other side. As we sat there, a beautiful Japanese lady dressed in a kimono shuffled in and out, being careful to bow every time she entered and exited the room. It must have taken her about 15 minutes to serve us all because she carried nearly 200 different dishes and plates for what was I think the most extravagant meal I have ever had. And then it struck me. Me being 23 years old at the time was the only person at that lunch below age 40. It was at that moment I realized that I had to mature very quickly and be a professional. Looking back, I would say I learned a lot from that job; and especially that lunch.</li>

                        <li> Invoca is a cloud-based performance marketing company in the affiliate marketing industry. They are an industry-leading company that delivers a complete call-marketing solution, which includes features such as sophisticated call-tracking, flexible campaign-management, powerful analytics, and clear call-attribution. Invoca's platform is developed using Ruby on Rails and Agile/Scrum-based methodologies.</li> 

                        <li>As a QA Software Engineer, my job was to create and execute test plans; debugging issues over the full software stack (front-end, application logic, services, data persistence) as well as server-side configuration issues. During this process, emphasis was placed on creating behavior driven test plans to simulate user-caused state, a valuable perspective to have that has helped me tremendously for when I design and write software. Furthermore, I worked closely with the development team to promote software quality while dealing with a large code base, complex server infrastructure, rapidly growing database, and upgrading from Rails2 to Rails3. </li>
